        <p class="P1"> I have just met Kay and I can happily say she is a total delight!
           Super fun to talk to <br> with an engaging personality. She is most recently
           coming from a positon working <br>for a non profit organization as a 
           project manager. On her free time she loves to create <br>memories with 
           her daughter as well as create a beautiful home for them. While she
           has <br>a very positive approach to parenting which allows for comfort 
           in her home she takes a<br> huge interest in interior design. She absolutely 
           adores intricate furniture and detailing in<br> creating a beautiful living space.
           Kay has a very open mindset which allows her to be <br> open to new ideas, new oppurtunities,
           and new people. This makes conversation with Kay <br> enligthening and fun! She has a very 
           positive outlook in the world which aligns with her <br> beliefs in peace and gratitude for what
           the universe delivers. Something fun Kay aims to <br> add back into her routine is writing inspirational 
           quotes on her mirror with lipstick. Such <br> a creative and fun way to express herself!
